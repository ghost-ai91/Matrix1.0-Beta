# DONUT Referral Matrix System

A decentralized multi-level referral system built on Solana blockchain that rewards participants for onboarding new users through a structured 3×1 matrix mechanism.

## Overview

The DONUT Referral Matrix System implements a novel incentive structure using a 3-slot matrix for each participant. When a new user joins with a referrer, they fill one of the referrer's slots, triggering specific financial actions:

- **Slot 1**: SOL is deposited to Meteora liquidity pools
- **Slot 2**: SOL is reserved and DONUT tokens are minted based on the pool's spot price
- **Slot 3**: Reserved SOL and tokens are paid to the referrer, completing their matrix

Once all three slots are filled, a new matrix is created, allowing continuous participation in the ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Verifiable Smart Contract**: Open-source, auditable, and fully on-chain code
- **Chainlink Integration**: Reliable SOL/USD price oracles for minimum deposit validation
- **Meteora Pool Integration**: Direct interaction with official token pool with 100% locked liquidity
- **Secure Address Verification**: Strict validation of all critical addresses
- **Automated Upline Processing**: Manages referral chain relationships automatically
- **Token Minting Control**: Protection against pool manipulations for mint calculations

## Technical Architecture

### Matrix Structure
Each user operates a personal 3-slot matrix that captures referrals and controls financial operations. The system:
- Tracks slot filling in a ReferralChain structure
- Automatically processes new matrices when one is completed
- Emits on-chain events for referral tracking

### Upline Management
- Optimized data structures for memory efficiency
- Complete tracking between referrers and referees

### Pool Integration
- SOL deposits flow directly to the official token pool on Meteora with 100% locked liquidity
- Pool interaction is secured through address verification

### Chainlink Oracles
- SOL/USD price verification for minimum deposit determination
- Protection against stale price feeds (fallback to default price)
- Strict validation of Chainlink program and price feed addresses

### Token Economics
- DONUT tokens are minted based on the current spot price in the Meteora pool

### Security Features
- Rigorous account and address validation
- Detailed error handling for transparency
- Memory optimization to prevent computation errors
- Protection against reentrancy and other common vulnerabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Solana CLI: v1.18.15 or higher
- Anchor Framework: v0.29.0
- Rust: v1.75.0 or higher (recommended)
- NodeJS: v16.0.0 or higher (for testing and scripts)

### Program Dependencies
```toml
anchor-lang = "0.29.0"
anchor-spl = "0.29.0"
solana-program = "1.18.15"
spl-token = "4.0.0"
chainlink_solana = "1.0.0"
solana-security-txt = "1.1.1"
```

### Accounts and PDAs
- `program_state`: Global program state
- `user_account`: Individual user accounts
- `program_sol_vault`: Program's SOL reserve
- `token_mint_authority`: Token minting authority
- `token_vault_authority`: Token transfer authority

### Data Structures
- `UserAccount`: Stores user data, referrals, and matrix
- `ReferralUpline`: Chain of referrers
- `ReferralChain`: 3×1 matrix for each user
- `UplineEntry`: Detailed data for each referrer

## Program Instructions

1. **initialize**: Initialize the program state
2. **register_without_referrer**: Administrative registration without referrer (multisig only)
3. **register_with_sol_deposit**: Register a new user with SOL deposit

## Build Optimization

The project uses optimized build settings for release:
- Full LTO (Link Time Optimization)
- Single codegen unit for maximum optimization
- Overflow checks enabled for additional security
- Custom build overrides for optimal performance
